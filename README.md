## Anime Auto

#### Umm, What?
- This is my own personal automated script to automatically look for new episode and download to local
- It works with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) database to sync episodes (actually do not need it, but I wanted to try Firebase so)

#### Left to be added to project later
- I haven't added FTP support and Email updates to user's email as I am cleaning up the code and not very important to use the script

#### Anime downloader
Anime Scraper and Downloader is from my another project, ["Anime Heaven Downloader"](https://github.com/the-robot/animeheaven-downloader)
- Go check that out if you want normal simple anime downloader
- **WARN:** never ever touch that source from `downloader` directory, as the code is directly from the project mentioned above and any code changes for downloader should be from there
